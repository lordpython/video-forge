# Video Forge API Testing Summary

## Overview

The Video Forge API provides a complete workflow for creating video content:

1. **Story Acquisition** - Create and manage story concepts
2. **Story Generation** - Generate detailed story content
3. **Script Generation** - Create scripts from stories
4. **Voice Over Generation** - Generate voice-overs from scripts

## API Structure

The API follows a RESTful design with endpoints grouped by functionality:

- `/routes/stories/*` - Story management and generation
- `/routes/scripts/*` - Script generation and management
- `/routes/voices` and related endpoints - Voice selection and voice-over generation

## Authentication

The API uses Firebase Authentication:
- Bearer token authentication via the `authorization` header
- Project ID: `project-soul-448918`
- All endpoints except those specifically configured with `disableAuth: true` require authentication

## Testing Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during testing:

1. **Authentication Requirements**: Most endpoints require Firebase authentication
2. **Databutton Storage Issues**: SSL certificate verification fails when attempting to use Databutton storage
3. **External Service Dependencies**: Voice-over generation requires ElevenLabs API access

## Testing Solutions Implemented

1. **Direct Test Endpoint**: Added `/test-direct` endpoint that bypasses authentication and provides API information
2. **Test API Module**: Created a simple test API module without Databutton dependencies
3. **Comprehensive Test Script**: Developed a Python script (`api_test.py`) that can test individual endpoints or complete workflows
4. **Test Plan**: Created a detailed test plan documenting the API structure and test methodology

## API Test Endpoints

Accessing http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-direct provides detailed information about:
- All available API routes and their authentication requirements
- Environment configuration
- Authentication system in use

## Recommendations for Complete Testing

1. **Mock Storage Layer**:
   - Implement a mock storage layer for Databutton to avoid SSL issues in testing

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add an environment variable to disable authentication for all routes during testing
   - Add an option to use in-memory or file-based storage instead of Databutton for testing

3. **Test User Account**:
   - Create a dedicated test user with Firebase credentials for automated testing

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Expand the test script to include more edge cases and error scenarios
   - Add integration tests that mock external services like ElevenLabs

## Usage Instructions

### Test Direct Endpoint

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-direct | jq .
```

### Using the Python Test Script

```bash
# Test the direct test endpoint
python api_test.py --test-direct

# Test story endpoints (requires auth disabled)
python api_test.py --test-stories

# Test the complete workflow (requires auth disabled)
python api_test.py --test-all

# Test with auth token
python api_test.py --test-all --test-auth --token "YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN"
```

### Modifying Auth Requirements

To disable authentication for testing, edit `routers.json` and set `disableAuth: true` for specific routers:

```json
{
  "routers": {
    "story_acquisition": {
      "name": "story_acquisition",
      "version": "2025-03-06T17:05:58",
      "disableAuth": true
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The Video Forge API provides a well-structured foundation for video content creation with a complete workflow from story concept to voice-over generation. With the appropriate authentication credentials and external service access, the API should function as expected. The test utilities created will assist in validating functionality as development continues.
