# AI Video Creator - Focus Areas and Simplification Suggestions

This document outlines key focus areas for development and suggestions to simplify the AI Video Creator application, especially in the early stages.

## Initial Development Focus

For the initial stages of development, prioritize these areas:

1.  **Core Backend Functionality & AI Workflow (Stage 2):** This is the engine of the application and needs to be reliable.
    *   **CrewAI Agent Implementation & Orchestration:** Get agents functioning and communicating.
    *   **API Integrations (Serper, Pexels, ElevenLabs):** Ensure successful API integration and copyright safeguards.
    *   **Basic Video Assembly (FFmpeg):** Get basic video merging working.
    *   **Task Queue Integration:** Implement task queue for asynchronous processing.
    *   **Database Integration for Status Tracking:** Track video generation status.

2.  **Basic Frontend Input & Output (Partial Stage 3):**  A minimal UI to test the backend.
    *   **Input Form (Basic):** Simple form for essential inputs (topic, duration, voice).
    *   **Submit Button & Basic Feedback:** Basic "Processing..." message.
    *   **Video Output (Basic Download Link):** Provide a download link for the generated video.

## Simplification Suggestions

To reduce complexity, especially in the early stages, consider these simplifications:

**1. Simplify the Technology Stack:**

*   **Choose a "Full-Stack" Framework (if feasible):** Next.js or Nuxt.js for both frontend and backend.
*   **Opt for a Simpler Backend Framework:** Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js).
*   **Consider a No-Code/Low-Code Backend (for initial prototype):** Firebase, Supabase, Backendless (with caution for long-term).
*   **Simplify Database Choice:** SQLite for local dev, PostgreSQL or MongoDB for cloud (simpler options).

**2. Simplify the AI Workflow:**

*   **Start with Fewer Agents in CrewAI:** Combine Script & Media Agent initially.
*   **Simplify Prompts:** Keep initial prompts concise and focused on essential functionality.
*   **Reduce Scene Complexity (Initially):** Simpler video structures, fewer scenes.
*   **Limit Voice Tone Options (at first):** Start with 2-3 core voice tones.
*   **Skip Optional Image Upload (for MVP):** Remove for the very first version.

**3. Simplify Feature Scope (MVP Focus):**

*   **Focus on the Core Video Generation Flow:** Prioritize topic-to-video flow.
*   **Minimal UI Polish for MVP:** Functionality over aesthetics initially.
*   **Skip User Accounts and Project Management (for MVP):** Focus on single video generation.
*   **Basic Error Handling UI (for MVP):** Basic error messages are sufficient initially.
*   **Limit Output Video Format (initially):** Single common format (e.g., MP4, 1080p).

**4. Simplify Development Process:**

*   **Iterative Development:** Build, test, feedback, iterate.
*   **Prioritize "Working Code" over "Perfect Code" (initially):** Focus on functionality.
*   **Test Frequently and Early:** Test backend and AI workflow early.
*   **Use Existing Libraries and Tools:** Leverage existing tools and libraries.
*   **Start with a Local Development Setup:** Focus on local testing first.

**Key Principle: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

Focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first to validate the core concept, reduce development time, and iterate based on real user feedback.
